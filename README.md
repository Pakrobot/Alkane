A little about alkanes

Given a structural formula of a chemical compound or molecule, one can always construct a graphical representation of such molecule or compound in graph theory.
Thus we define a molecular graph of a molecule or compound as a labeled graph with vertices consisting of the atoms of the molecule and edges representing the chemical bond existing between the atoms. In this vain we define an Alkane as a simple molecular graph whose vertices consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms and edges are single bonds between the atoms. Alkanes are also known as hyrocarbons
