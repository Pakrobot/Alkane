# Alkane
A little about alkanes

Given a structural formula of a chemical compound or molecule, one can always construct a graphical representation of such molecule or compound in graph theory.
Thus we define a molecular graph of a molecule or compound as a labeled graph with vertices consisting of the atoms of the molecule and edges representing the chemical bond existing between the atoms. We refer to the compound as saturated if the bond between atoms are single an unsturated if the bond is a double bond. In this vain we define a saturated hydrocarbon as a simple molecular graph whose vertices consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms and edges represent single bonds between the atoms. Alkanes are acyclic saturated hyrocarbons.  


Recently developed quantum graph partitioning and quantum community detection techniques on the D-wave annealer opens up opportunities to use the D-Wave quantum annealer for combinatorial chemistry. To this end, our project seeks to explore the problem of isomer search, a very important problem in pharmaceutical drug research and to encode the problem into the architecture of quantum computing. We seek to formulate a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization for the problem and use the D-wave quantum annealer to find the isomer with the minimal energy. Thus Darwin's Ising D-wave machine will be very helpful in achieving our goals.

I will be working with the Ising D-wave machine to develop a quantum algorithm for  combinatorial chemistry isomer search.
