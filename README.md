A little about alkanes

Given a structural formula of a chemical compound or molecule, one can always construct a graphical representation of such molecule or compound in graph theory.
Thus we define a molecular graph of a molecule or compound as a labeled graph with vertices consisting of the atoms of the molecule and edges representing the chemical bond existing between the atoms. We refer to the compound as saturated if the bond between atoms are single an unsturated if the bond is a double bond. In this vain we define a saturated hydrocarbon as a simple molecular graph whose vertices consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms and edges represent single bonds between the atoms. Alkanes are acyclic saturated hyrocarbons.
